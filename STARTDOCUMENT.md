# Startdocument for Store

Startdocument of **Jan Doornbos**. Studentnumber **1234567**.

## Problem Description

We have a store with two types of customers. A regular customer: he has a customer number, name and city. There also is a premium customer: he is the same as a regular customer, but also has a discount percentage. All customers have a prefix in the customer number: MM_. This prefix is the same for all customers. If this prefix is changed, it should update for ALL the customers. Make a method that returns this prefix and the customer number combined.
* Make a store that holds both types of customers.
* Make a method that can fetch all the customers from a certain city.
* Make a method that removes all the customers with a customer number smaller than a given value.
* Document your code with Javadoc.
* Write Unit tests for your application.
